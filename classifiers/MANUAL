DESCRIPTIONS
This folder contains a software, tts_prediction, that predicts transcription termination sites in Maize (and it is also applicable for other species by using customized motifs and re-trained classifier).

tts_prediction computes features from a fixed size of genome scanning window, where there are three feature categories, (di)nucleotide frequency, motif occurence, and transcript local secondary structure and feeds these features into support vector machine with optimized kernel for Maize (if you want to apply it for other species, see EXTENSION for more details) 

DENPENDENCIES
To use tts_prediction, you need Python packages: sklearn, numpy, matplotlib and Bio

INSTALL
> ./setup.sh # it install all dependencies and add tts_prediction into $PATH
> ./test.sh  # test if setup runs correctly  

USAGE
> ./tts_prediction Maize_classifer [your_Maize_genome.fa] > [output] 

EXTENSION
coming soon
