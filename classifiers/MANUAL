DESCRIPTIONS
This folder contains a software, tts_prediction, that predicts transcription termination sites in Maize (and it is also applicable for other species by using customized motifs and re-trained classifier).

tts_prediction computes features from a fixed size of genome scanning window, where there are three feature categories, (di)nucleotide frequency, motif occurence, and transcript local secondary structure and feeds these features into support vector machine with optimized kernel for Maize (if you want to apply it for other species, see EXTENSION for more details) 

DENPENDENCIES
To use tts_prediction, you need Python packages: sklearn, numpy, matplotlib and Bio

INSTALL
> source setup # it install all dependencies and source the Python library used by tts_prediction
> ./test.sh  # test if tts_prediction runs correctly  

USAGE
1. Print the usage of tts_predction
> python tts_prediction.py --help

2. Run an example: use test_classifier as classifier and predict the TTS in test_genome.fa. "motifs/" indicates the path of motifs used by classifier and "output" points to the output file
> python tts_prediction.py test_classifier genome/test_genome.fa motifs/ > output 


EXTENSION
In this section, we talk about the usage of tts_predction.py
1. Print the usage of tts_prediction_train
> python tts_prediction_train.py --help

2. Run an example 
> python tts_prediction_train.py training_datasets/test_training.txt training_datasets/test_test.txt motifs/ save test_classifier

3. Train a new classifier with customized feature functions
